 * P1 (planning and booking) Plan a trip by first planning a flight (i.e.
 * getting a list of flights and then adding a flight to the itinerary), then by
 * planning a hotel, another flight, a third flight, and finally a hotel. Ask
 * for the itinerary and check that it is correct using JUnit’s assert
 * statements – i.e. assertEquals, assertTrue, . . . – in particular, that the
 * booking status for each item is unconfirmed. Book the itinerary and ask again
 * for the itinerary. Check that each booking status is now confirmed
